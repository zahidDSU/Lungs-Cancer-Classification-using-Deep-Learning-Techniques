# Lungs-Cancer-Classification-using-Deep-Learning-Techniques

# Project Overview
The "Lung Cancer Classification using Deep Learning Techniques" project is a deep learning and medical imaging project designed to classify lung cancer based on medical images. This project leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to assist in the early detection of lung cancer, a critical area in medical diagnostics.

# Dataset Description
The dataset comprises a collection of medical images, specifically lung CT scans. Each image is associated with binary labels, indicating the presence (positive) or absence (negative) of lung cancer. The project aims to utilize these labeled images to train a deep learning model for accurate classification.

# Key Components:
Medical Images: The dataset includes a substantial number of lung CT scan images, varying in complexity.
Binary Labels: Each image is associated with a binary label, serving as ground truth for cancer presence.
Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project include:

## Data Preprocessing: 
Thoroughly preprocess and prepare the medical images for deep learning, ensuring image quality and compatibility with the model.

## Deep Learning Architecture: 
Design and implement a deep learning model, incorporating convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction.

## Training: 
Train the deep learning model using the labeled dataset, fine-tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance.

## Model Evaluation:
